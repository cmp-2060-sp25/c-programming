# c-programming
Since the Linux kernel is written in C, our labs will rely heavily on it.

In order to run C on your machine, you need a compiler. The most famous compiler is [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/). 

## Installation
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install build-essential
# verify your installation
gcc --version
# gcc (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0
# Copyright (C) 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
# This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
# warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```
## Compilation & Execution
```bash
# Create an executable
gcc hello.c -o hello.out
# Run the executable
./hello.out
# Compile and execute the output file
gcc hello.c -o hello.out && ./hello.out
```
**Passing Arguments**

It's possible to read arguments into your program
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Number of arguments passed: %d\n", argc);

    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
`argc` will have the count of arguments passed to your main, while `argv` is an array of character arrays holding the passed arguments. `argv[0]` will have the name of the program being executed.

Be careful that arguments are always considered `char*`, even if you pass integers, they will be considered as characters.

**Compiling multiple files**
```bash
gcc main.c hello.c factorial.c -o hello
```
**What if we only changed one file, do we need to build everything?!**

### Make Build
Compiling your source code files can be tedious, specially when you want to include several source files and have to type the compiling command every time you want to do
it.
Makefiles are special format files that together with the make utility will help you to automatically build and manage your projects.

**The `make` utility**

If you run `make` this program will look for a file named makefile in your directory, and then execute it.
If you have several makefiles, then you can execute them with the command:
```bash
make -f MyMakefile
```
There are several other switches to the make utility. For more info, `man make`.

**Build Process**
1. Compiler takes the source files and outputs object files
2. Linker takes the object files and creates an executable

The basic makefile is composed of:
```make
target: dependencies
[tab] system command
```
This syntax applied to our example would look like:
```make
all:
    gcc main.c hello.c factorial.c -o hello
```
To run this makefile on your files, type:
```bash
make -f Makefile-1
```
- On this first example we see that our target is called `all`. This is the default target for makefiles. 
- The make utility will execute this target if no other one is specified.
- We also see that there are no dependencies for target `all`, so make safely executes the system commands specified.
- Finally, make compiles the program according to the command line we gave it.

**Using dependencies**

Sometimes is useful to use different targets. This is because if you modify a
single file in your project, you don't have to recompile everything, only what
you modified.
```make
all: hello

hello: main.o factorial.o hello.o
	gcc main.o factorial.o hello.o -o hello

# The -c flag tells the compiler to generate an object file (e.g., myprogram.o) without linking it into an executable.
main.o: main.c
	gcc -c main.c

factorial.o: factorial.c
	gcc -c factorial.c

hello.o: hello.c
	gcc -c hello.c

clean:
	rm -rf *o hello
```
- Now we see that the target `all` has only dependencies, but no system commands.In order for make to execute correctly, it has to meet all the dependencies of thecalled target (in this case `all`).
- Each of the dependencies are searched through all the targets available and executed if found.
- In this example we see a target called `clean`. It is useful to have such target if you want to have a fast way to get rid of all the object files and executables.
```bash
make -f Makefile-2 clean
```

**Using variables and comments**
You can also use variables when writing Makefiles. It comes in handy in situations where you want to change the compiler, or the compiler options.
```make
# I am a comment, and I want to say that the variable CC will be
# the compiler to use.
CC=gcc
# Hey!, I am comment number 2. I want to say that CFLAGS will be the
# options I'll pass to the compiler.
# -c: Compile source files into object files (.o) without linking
# -Wall: Enable all warnings
CFLAGS=-c -Wall

all: hello

hello: main.o factorial.o hello.o
	$(CC) main.o factorial.o hello.o -o hello

main.o: main.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.c

factorial.o: factorial.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) factorial.c

hello.o: hello.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) hello.c

clean:
	rm -rf *o hello
```
As you can see, variables can be very useful sometimes. To use them, just assign a value to a variable before you start to write your targets. After that,
you can just use them with the dereference operator `$(VAR)`.

With this brief introduction to Makefiles, you can create some very
sophisticated mechanism for compiling your projects.
```make

# C Compiler
CC=gcc 

CFLAGS=-c -Wall

# LDFLAGS is typically used for linker flags
LDFLAGS=

# List of C source files
SOURCES=main.c hello.c factorial.c

# Convert all .c files in SOURCES to .o files using Makefile substitution
# Example: If SOURCES=main.c hello.c factorial.c, then OBJECTS=main.o hello.o factorial.o
OBJECTS=$(SOURCES:.c=.o)

# The final executable file name
EXECUTABLE=hello

# 'all' depends on the source files and the final executable
all: $(SOURCES) $(EXECUTABLE)
# Maps to: 
# all: main.c hello.c factorial.c hello
# If the `hello` file is missing, make searches for a rule that defines how to create this file

# Rule to build the final executable from object files
# $(EXECUTABLE) depends on all .o files (stored in $(OBJECTS))
# $@ represents the target (hello)
$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@
# Maps to:
# hello: main.o hello.o factorial.o
#	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@
# If it can't find .o files, it will look for a rule to create them


# Pattern rule to compile .c files into .o files
# This tells `make` if a .o file is needed but missing, check if a .c file with the same name exists. If it exists, then for any .c file, generate a .o file
.c.o:
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@
# $< represents the first prerequisite (the .c file, e.g., main.c)
# $@ represents the target (the .o file, e.g., main.o)
# If the files exist, `make` checks modification times of each .c and .o files. If any .c file is newer than its corresponding .o file, make recompiles it. 
# Maps to:
# gcc -c -Wall main.c -o main.o
# gcc -c -Wall hello.c -o hello.o
# gcc -c -Wall factorial.c -o factorial.o

# To clean the build (remove generated files), you can add:
# Running 'make clean' will remove all .o files and the executable.
clean:
	rm -f $(OBJECTS) $(EXECUTABLE)
```

**Summary Notes on `make` behavior:**

1. If `hello` (the executable) doesn't exist, `make` looks for a rule to create it.
2. It sees that `hello` depends on `object` files and ensures they exist.
3. If an `object` file doesn't exist, make checks for a rule to create it.
4. The pattern rule `.c.o:` tells make if a `.o` file is needed but missing, check if a `.c` file with the same name exists, if it exists then this rule `.c.o:` tells make how to generate(compile) those `.c` files to `.o` files.
5. If an `object` file is older than its corresponding `.c` file, it is recompiled.
6. Finally, the `object` files are linked together to create the executable.

You could adapt it to your own personal projects changing only 2 lines, no
matter how many additional files you have.

## Debugging

For debugging your application, [`gdb`](https://sourceware.org/gdb/) is a very powerful tool in hand.
```bash
# compile your C program with the -g flag to include debugging information
gcc -g -o myprogram myprogram.c

# Run the Program
# Launch your gdb program
gdb ./myprogram

# Run the Program
# Start the program
(gdb) run
# Short for r
(gdb) r
# Start the program with arguments
(gdb) run arg1 arg2

# Set Breakpoints
# Set a breakpoint at a specific line
(gdb) break 10
# Short for b
(gdb) b
# Set a breakpoint at a function
(gdb) break my_function
# Show info about your breakpoints
(gdb) info break
# To remove a specific breakpoint (e.g., breakpoint number 1):
(gdb) delete 1
# To remove all breakpoints at once:
(gdb) delete

# Continue Execution
# Resume the program until the next breakpoint or end:
(gdb) continue
# Short for c
(gdb) c

# Step Execution 
# step: Execute the next line of code and step into functions if applicable.
(gdb) step
# Short for s
(gdb) s
# next: Execute the next line but do not step into functions.
(gdb) next
# Short for n
(gdb) n
# The finish command resumes execution until the current function returns. Once the function is complete, it will pause at the line following the function call.
(gdb) finish

# Print Variables
# Print the value of a variable:
(gdb) print var_name
# Short for p var_name
(gdb) p var_name
# Assign a Value to a Variable
(gdb) set var variable_name = new_value

# Backtrace
# Display the call stack (useful for identifying where a crash occurred):
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) where
# You can use the frame command to display the current function and line:
(gdb) frame


# Watch Variables
# Automatically stop execution when a variableâ€™s value changes:
(gdb) watch var_name
# Show info about your watched variables
(gdb) info watch

# List Source Code
# Display a portion of the source code:
(gdb) list
# Short for l
(gdb) l
# Show code for a specific function
(gdb) l main

# Quit gdb
# Exit the debugger:
(gdb) quit
# Short for q
(gdb) q
```
